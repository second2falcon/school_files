# School files

A collection of exercises and notes taken during class.<br />

There will probably be incorrect information in this repository, so take everything with a grain of salt.

(I also did not use markdown when I first started using git, so the formatting is a bit off. Mainly in the <a href="https://github.com/second2falcon/school_files/blob/main/2021-2022/Geschiedenis/geschiedenis.md">notes from history class</a>.)
