1. 

    I think this story begins in media res since we are just thrown into someones life.

2. 

    I think the perspective in this story is the third person since there is not a single usage of "I" as opposed to the number of "he"s used in this story.

3. 

    The setting in this story is in a kitchen and livingroom with low amounts of light. I think this setting was chosen for the creepy vibe it's giving which builds suspense.

4. 

    The narrative structure in this story is linear since is just goes from a to b.

5. 

    This writer builds suspense by giving the story a creepy vibe or an unsetteling feeling. This is dont by the main character letting someone in he doesn't know and that in a (ealier) barely litt room.

6. 

    Grahams son enters.
    a) This story has an open end since we don't know what happens after Graham took the loaded revolver from his son.
    b) This story has a cliffhanger implemented since we don't know what happens with the gun Graham took from his son.
    c) This has the effect that the reader want to know how this story continues.

7. 

    Mr Nieman tries to kill Graham's son by giving him a weapon.
