I think that this story begins in media res, because in the beginning we don't know why Klara is so worried. I know this because later in the story she tells us about how her other children died.

I think that this story is written in the third perspective, because in the story words like the Doctor, she and others are often used, which indicates a third perspective since not a single time the word I is used to describe who said or did something.

I think that the setting of this book is in the early 1900s judging from the names and the history we all know of, and the story is playing inside a hospital (which could be in Austria). I think this because Adolf Hitler's mother names was Klara, he moved a lot and had a lot of dead siblings (which are all named in this story). The hospital part I think because there is a doctor and if you are about to give birth, it's not too uncommond to go to a hospital.

I think the narrative structure is using flashbacks since we go back into the past to learn about the death of Klara's children. I know this because we see on multiple occasions that she had kids  which all died.
