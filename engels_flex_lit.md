1. 

    I think this story beging ab ovo, because there are no flashbacks. I know this because we are never leaving the present.

2. 

    I think the perspective in this story is the third person since there is not a single usage of "I" as opposed to the number of "he"s used in this story.

3. 

    The setting in this story is in a kitchen and livingroom with low amounts of light. I think this setting was chosen for the creepy vibe it's giving.

4. 

    The narrative structure in this story is parallel since the ending isn't what you would expect if you only read the beginning of this story.

5. 

    This writer builds suspense by giving the story a creepy vibe or an unsetteling feeling. This is dont by the main character letting someone in he doesn't know and that in a (ealier) barely litt room.

6. 

    a) This story has an open end since we don't know what happens after Graham took the loaded revolver from his son.
    b) This story has a cliffhanger implemented since we don't know what happens with the gun Graham took from his son.
    c) This has the effect that the reader want to know how this story continues.

7. 

    Graham is actually a weapon and arms developer developing a weapon of big potential (possibly big distructive power).
